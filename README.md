### Date created
The Bike Share project in Python was created on 12-Aug-2021 and the README.md
file was created on 23-Aug-2021.

### Project Title
Explore US Bike Share data

### Description
The project explores the bike share use in Chicago, New York City and
Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics.

Based on the user input, the code computes and provides the following information
for one of the three cities:

##### 1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

##### 2. Popular stations and trip
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start
station and end station)

##### 3. Trip duration
total travel time
average travel time

##### 4. User info
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

The files contain randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017  for
the three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City and
Washington, D.C. Each file has the following columns:
- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

In addition, Chicago and New York City files have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year

### Credits
The data was provided by **Motivate**, a bike share system provider for many
major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.
